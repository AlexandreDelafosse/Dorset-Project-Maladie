                <p> The Schizophrenia Society of Canada (SSC) was started as a non-profit, charitable organization in Toronto in
                    1979 by Bill Jefferies and his wife who had a son living with schizophrenia. Within a few years there were
                    provincial schizophrenia societies across Canada.

                    As parents and caregivers they were quite aware of the stigma, prejudice, and discrimination associated with
                    schizophrenia, one of the world’s most devastating mental illnesses. </p>
