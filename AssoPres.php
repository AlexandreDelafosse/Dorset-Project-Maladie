                <p> The Schizophrenia Society of Canada (SSC) was started as a non-profit, charitable organization in
                    Toronto in
                    1979 by Bill Jefferies and his wife who had a son living with schizophrenia. Within a few years
                    there were
                    provincial schizophrenia societies across Canada.

                    <br>
                    As parents and caregivers they were quite aware of the stigma, prejudice, and discrimination
                    associated with
                    schizophrenia, one of the world’s most devastating mental illnesses. </p>
