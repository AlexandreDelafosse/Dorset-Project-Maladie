        <p class="sch">Schizophrenia is a <span class="violet2">brain disease</span> that affects thinking, <span
                class="violet2">feelings</span> and <span class="violet2">emotions</span>, as well as <span
                class="violet2">perceptions</span> and
            <span class="violet2">behaviour</span>. However, not all of these functions are affected at the same time
            and to the same degree.
            Many people with schizophrenia can behave perfectly normally for long periods of time.
        </p>
        <p class="sch2">Schizophrenia often causes a number of <span class="violet2">cognitive deficits</span> that
            affect attention, memory, learning and
            information processing.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="text3">
            <span class="violet2">The Schizophrenia Society of Canada</span> (SSC) was started as a non-profit,
            charitable organization in Toronto in
            1979 by Bill Jefferies and his wife who had a son living with schizophrenia.
            Within a few years there were provincial schizophrenia societies across Canada. As parents and caregivers
            they were quite aware of the <span class="violet2">stigma</span>, <span class="violet2">prejudice</span>,
            and <span class="violet2">discrimination</span> associated with schizophrenia, one of the
            world’s most devastating <span class="violet2">mental illnesses</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="text4">Their lived experience as family members fueled their passion and vision that more could be
            done, not only
            those living with schizophrenia, but also for families. Families had no voice. Thus, the SSC’s mission had a
            strong emphasis on <span class="violet2">advocacy</span>, which remains to this day.</p>

        <img class="logo2" src="img/logo_05.png" alt="logo">

        <p class="text4">Today, SSC has a strong conviction that things can definitely be different and better for those experiencing
            early psychosis and for the one in one hundred who will develop schizophrenia.</p>
        <p class="text4">SSC is committed to transforming how people think, with knowledge and youthful enthusiasm. We seek to be an
            inspirational visionary in advocating for a <span class="violet2">transformed mental health system</span> that is based upon the recovery
            philosophy.</p>
